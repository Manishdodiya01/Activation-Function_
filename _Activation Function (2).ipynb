    "Q5. What is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function? How does it differ from the sigmoid function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is an activation function commonly used in neural networks. Unlike the sigmoid function, which squashes its input to a range between 0 and 1, ReLU is defined as follows:\n",

    "ReLU\n",

    "0\n",
    ",\n",
    "�\n",
    ")\n",
    "ReLU(x)=max(0,x)\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, if the input is positive, ReLU returns the input; otherwise, it returns zero. This results in a piecewise linear function that introduces non-linearity to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference from the sigmoid function lies in the non-linearity introduced by ReLU. While sigmoid squashes the input to a specific range and has a smooth curve, ReLU allows positive values to pass through unchanged, providing a simpler and computationally efficient activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What are the benefits of using the ReLU activation function over the sigmoid function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ReLU offers several advantages over the sigmoid function, particularly in the context of deep neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoids Vanishing Gradient Problem: One significant issue with the sigmoid and tanh activation functions is the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradients become very small during backpropagation. This can hinder the training of deep networks. ReLU, being piecewise linear, does not saturate for positive inputs, avoiding the vanishing gradient problem and allowing for more effective learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Efficiency: The ReLU activation function is computationally more efficient compared to sigmoid and tanh because it involves simple thresholding operations. This efficiency becomes crucial in training large and deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse Activation: ReLU activation results in sparse activation patterns, meaning that only a subset of neurons in a layer is activated for a given input. This can lead to a more efficient representation of the data and can reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of Optimization: The non-saturation property of ReLU simplifies the optimization process during training. The absence of a saturation region means that the gradients remain large for positive inputs, allowing for faster convergence during gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biologically Plausible: ReLU has been suggested to be more biologically plausible as a model of neuron activation compared to sigmoid and tanh, as it more closely resembles the firing behavior of real neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "While ReLU has these advantages, it's essential to be aware of its limitations, such as the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where neurons can become inactive (always outputting zero) during training. Variants like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU have been introduced to address this issue by allowing a small, positive gradient for negative inputs. The choice of activation function often depends on the specific characteristics of the problem and empirical observations during model development and training.\n",
